# Motivating Example

Suppose you are the owner of the *Momma Leonaâ€™s Pizza*, a restaurant chain located near several college campuses. You currently own 10 stores and have data on the size of the student population as well as quarterly sales for each. Your data is summarized in the table below.

| Restaurant, $i$ | Student Population, $x_i$, in 1000s | Quarterly Sales, $y_i$, in $1000s |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1               | 2                                   | 58                                |
| 2               | 6                                   | 105                               |
| 3               | 8                                   | 88                                |
| 4               | 8                                   | 118                               |
| 5               | 12                                  | 117                               |
| 6               | 16                                  | 137                               |
| 7               | 20                                  | 157                               |
| 8               | 20                                  | 169                               |
| 9               | 22                                  | 149                               |
| 10              | 26                                  | 202                               |

How can you use this data to 

- Explain relationship
- Predict

One tool will do both, LINEAR REGRESSION

# WH___ ?s

# Model

# What is the Best Line?

historical, easy math

# Least Squares Approach

# MLE Approach

# Example

# `R`

# Decomposition

# $R^2$

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{n}(\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2
\]
