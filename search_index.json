To get started, you will need to install two pieces of software: R, the actual programming language, which can be installed from http://cran.r-project.org/ Chose your operating system, and select the most recent version. (As of writing, 3.3.0.) RStudio, an excellent IDE for working with R, which can be obtained from http://www.rstudio.com/ (Note, you must have R installed to use RStudio. RStudio is simply a way to interact with R.) R’s popularity is on the rise, and everyday it becomes a better tool for statistical analysis. It even generated this book! (A skill you will learn in this coruse.) There are many good resoruces for learning R. They are not necessary for this course, but you may find them useful if you would like a deeper understanding of R: Try R from Code School. An interactive introduction to the basics of R. Could be very useful for getting up to speed on R’s syntax. The Art of R Programming by Norman Matloff Gentle introduction to the programming side of R. (Whereas we will focus more on the data analysis side.) A free electronic version is available through the Illinois library. Advanced R by Hadley Wickham From the author of several extremely popular R packages. Good follow-up to The Art of R Programming. (And more up-to-date material.) The R Inferno by Patrick Burns Likens learning the tricks of R to descending through the levels of hell. Very advanced material, but may be important if R becomes a part of your everyday toolkit. RStudio has a large number of useful keyboard shortcuts. A list of these can be found using a keyboard shortcut, the keyboard shortcut to rule them all: On Windows: Option + Shift + K On Mac: Alt + Shift + K The RStudio team has developed a number of “cheatsheets” for working with both R and RStudio which can be found here or from the help menu inside of RStudio. This one for Base R in particular will summarize many of the concepts in this document. 2.1 Basic Calculations To get started, we’ll use R like a simple calculator. Note, in R the # symbol is used for comments. Lines which begin with two, ## will indicate output. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division 3 + 2 ## [1] 5 3 - 2 ## [1] 1 3 * 2 ## [1] 6 3 / 2 ## [1] 1.5 Exponents 3 ^ 2 ## [1] 9 2 ^ (-3) ## [1] 0.125 100 ^ (1 / 2) ## [1] 10 sqrt(1 / 2) ## [1] 0.7071068 exp(1) ## [1] 2.718282 Mathematical Constants pi ## [1] 3.141593 exp(1) ## [1] 2.718282 Logarithms log(10) # natural log ## [1] 2.302585 log10(1000) # base 10 log ## [1] 3 log2(8) # base 2 log ## [1] 3 log(16, base = 4) # base 4 log ## [1] 2 Trigonometry sin(pi / 2) ## [1] 1 cos(0) ## [1] 1 2.2 Getting Help In using R as a calculator, we have seen a number of functions. sqrt(), exp(), log() and sin() are all R functions. To get documentation about a function in R, simply put a question mark in front of the function name and RStudio will display the documentation, for example: ?log ?sin ?paste ?lm Frequently one of the most difficult things to do when learning R is asking for help. First, you need to decide to ask for help, then you need to know how to ask for help. Your very first line of defense should be to google your error message or a short description of your issue. (The ability to solve problems using this method is quickly becoming an extremely valuable skill.) If that fails, and it eventually will, you should ask for help There are a number of things you should include when emailing an instructor, or posting to a help website such as http://stats.stackexchange.com/. Describe what you expect the code to do. State the end goal you are trying to acheive. (Sometimes what you expect the code to do, is not what you want to actually do.) The full text of any errors you have recieved. Provide enough code to recreate the error. Often for the purpose of this course, you could simply email your entire .R or .Rmd file. Sometimes it is also helpful to include a screenshot of your entire RStudio window when the error occurs. If you follow these steps, you will get your issue resolved much quicker, and possibly learn more in the process. 2.3 Vectors Many operations in R make heavy use of vectors. Vectors in R are indexed starting at 1. That is what the [1] in the output is indicating, that the first element of the row being displayed is the first element of the vector. Larger vectors will start additional rows with [*] where * is the index of the first element of the row. Possibly the most common way to create a vector in R is using the c() function, which is short for combine. As the name suggests, it combines a list of numbers separated by commas. c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) ## [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 Here R simply outputs this vector. If we would like to store this vector in a variable we can do so with the assignment operator =. In this case the variable x now holds the vector we just created, and we can access the vector by typing x. x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) x ## [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 As an aside, there is a long history of the assignment operator in R. For simplicity we will use =, but know that often you will see &lt;- as the assignment operator. The pros and cons of these two are well beyond the scope of this book, but know that for our purposes you will have no issue if you simply use =. Frequently you may wish to create a vector based on a sequence of numbers. The quickest and easiest way to do this is with the : operator, which creates a sequence of integers between two specified integers. (y = 1:100) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ## [16] 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 ## [31] 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 ## [46] 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 ## [61] 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 ## [76] 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 ## [91] 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 Here we see R labeling the rows after the first since this is a large vector. Also, we see that by putting parentheses around the assignment, R both stores the vector in a variable called y and automatically outputs y to the console. If we want to create a sequence that isn’t limit to TODO: fine control sequence TODO: function and arguemnts, etc. where to put? (z = seq(from = 1, to = 2, by = 0.1)) ## [1] 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 TODO: add rep rep(0.5, times = 10) ## [1] 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 rep(x, 3) ## [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 TODO: Accessing elements x ## [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 x[3] ## [1] 5 x[1:3] ## [1] 1 3 5 x[-2] ## [1] 1 5 7 8 9 One of the biggest strengths of R is its use of vectorized operations. (Frequently the lack of understanding of this concept leads of a belief that R is slow. R isn’t the fastest language, but it has a reputation for being slower than it really is.) x = 1:10 x + 1 ## [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 2 * x ## [1] 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 2 ^ x ## [1] 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 sqrt(x) ## [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490 ## [7] 2.645751 2.828427 3.000000 3.162278 log(x) ## [1] 0.0000000 0.6931472 1.0986123 1.3862944 1.6094379 1.7917595 ## [7] 1.9459101 2.0794415 2.1972246 2.3025851 We see that when a function like log() is called on a vector x, a vector is returned which has applied the function to each element of the vector x. 2.4 Matrix Calculations R can also be used for matrix calculations. Matrices can be created using the matrix function. TODO: matrix all same “data”&quot; type. “order matters”. has rows and columns By default the matrix function reorders a vector into columns, but we can also tell R to use rows instead. x = 1:9 x ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 X = matrix(x, nrow = 3, ncol = 3) X ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 Y = matrix(x, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE) Y ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 3 ## [2,] 4 5 6 ## [3,] 7 8 9 Z = matrix(0, 2, 4) Z ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 0 0 0 0 ## [2,] 0 0 0 0 X ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 X[1, 2] ## [1] 4 X[1, ] ## [1] 1 4 7 X[, 2] ## [1] 4 5 6 X[2, c(1, 3)] ## [1] 2 8 Matrices can also be created by combining vectors as columns, using cbind or combining vectors as rows using rbind. x = 1:9 rev(x) ## [1] 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 rep(1, 9) ## [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 cbind(x, rev(x), rep(1, 9)) ## x ## [1,] 1 9 1 ## [2,] 2 8 1 ## [3,] 3 7 1 ## [4,] 4 6 1 ## [5,] 5 5 1 ## [6,] 6 4 1 ## [7,] 7 3 1 ## [8,] 8 2 1 ## [9,] 9 1 1 rbind(x, rev(x), rep(1, 9)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] ## x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ## 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ## 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 R can then be used to perform matrix calculations. x = 1:9 y = 9:1 X = matrix(x, 3, 3) Y = matrix(y, 3, 3) X ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 Y ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 9 6 3 ## [2,] 8 5 2 ## [3,] 7 4 1 X + Y ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 10 10 10 ## [2,] 10 10 10 ## [3,] 10 10 10 X - Y ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -8 -2 4 ## [2,] -6 0 6 ## [3,] -4 2 8 X * Y ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 9 24 21 ## [2,] 16 25 16 ## [3,] 21 24 9 X / Y ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 0.1111111 0.6666667 2.333333 ## [2,] 0.2500000 1.0000000 4.000000 ## [3,] 0.4285714 1.5000000 9.000000 Note that X * Y is not matrix multiplication. It is element by element multiplication. (Same for X / Y). Instead, matrix multiplication uses %*%. t() gives the transpose of a matrix, and solve() returns the inverse of a matrix.

We typically want to know one of four things: The density (pdf) value at a particular value of x. The distribution (cdf) value at a particular value of x. The quantile x value corresponding to a particular probability. A random value from a particular distribution. This used to be done with statistical tables printed in the back of textbooks. Now, R has functions for obtaining density, distribution, quantile and random values. The general naming structure of the relevant R functions is: dname calculates density (pdf) value at input x. pname calculates distribution (cdf) value at input x. qname calculates quantile x value at input probability. rname generates a random value from a particular distribution. Note that name represents the name of the given distribution. For example, to calculate the value of the pdf for a \\(N(2, 25)\\) for x = 3, use: dnorm(3, mean = 2, sd = 5) ## [1] 0.07820854 Or, to calculate the value of the cdf for a \\(N(2, 25)\\) for x = 3, use: pnorm(3, mean = 2, sd = 5) ## [1] 0.5792597 Or, to calculate the quantile for probability 0.975, use: qnorm(0.975, mean = 2, sd = 5) ## [1] 11.79982 Lastly, to generate a random sample of size n = 10, use: rnorm(10, mean = 2, sd = 5) ## [1] 4.7982908 5.5208097 -5.2304397 2.9797012 11.9817181 ## [6] -2.4391739 7.1766461 7.2586694 0.5579309 6.9819786 These functions exist for many other distributions, including but not limited to: Command Distribution *binom Binomial *t t *pois Poisson *f F *chisq Chi-Squared Where * can be d, p, q, and r. 2.6 Programming Basics 2.6.1 Logical Operators Operator Summary &lt; Less than &gt; Greater than &lt;= Less than or equal to &gt;= Greater than or equal to == Equal to != Not equal to !x NOT x x | y x OR y x &amp; y x AND y In R, logical operators are vectorized. heights = c(110, 120, 115, 136, 205, 156, 175) weights = c(64, 67, 62, 60, 77, 70, 66) heights &lt; 121 | heights == 156 ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE weights[heights &gt; 150] ## [1] 77 70 66 In R, the if/else syntax is: if (...) { some R code } else { more R code } For example, x = 1 y = 3 if (x &gt; y) { z = x * y print(&quot;x is larger than y&quot;) } else { z = x + 5 * y print(&quot;x is less than or equal to y&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;x is less than or equal to y&quot; z ## [1] 16 TODO: ifelse Now a for loop example, x = 11:15 for (i in 1:5) { x[i] = x[i] + 1 } x ## [1] 12 13 14 15 16 Note that this for loop is very normal in many programming languages, but not in R. In R we would not use a loop, instead we would simply use a vectorized operation: x = 11:15 x = x + 1 x ## [1] 12 13 14 15 16 Lastly, we can write our own functions in R. For example, standardize = function(x) { m = mean(x) std = sd(x) result = (x - m) / std result } x = rnorm(10, 2, 25) standardize(x) ## [1] -0.2131759 0.7136258 -1.0571250 -0.4584787 1.3813342 ## [6] -0.2137514 -0.8024888 0.3387538 1.6315605 -1.3202546 TODO: function with arguments, control flow, if based return, how return works get_sd = function(x, biased = FALSE) { n = length(x) if (biased) { std = sqrt((1 / n) * sum((x - mean(x)) ^ 2)) } else { std = sqrt((1 / (n - 1)) * sum((x - mean(x)) ^ 2)) } std } get_sd = function(x, biased = FALSE) { n = length(x) - 1 * biased sqrt((1 / n) * sum((x - mean(x)) ^ 2)) } \\[ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n - 1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x - \\bar{x})^2} \\] \\[ \\hat{\\sigma} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x - \\bar{x})^2} \\] TODO: Potentially save this for the SLR document, since it is already somewhat there. 2.7 Data Frames TODO: data frames. have observations and variables 2.8 Importing Data TODO: read() or RStudio 2.9 Scatter Plots 2.10 Hypothesis Tests in R 2.10.1 One Sample \\(t\\) Test: Review Suppose \\(x_{i} \\sim \\mathrm{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^{2})\\) and we want to test \\(H_{0}: \\mu = \\mu_{0}\\) versus \\(H_{1}: \\mu \\neq \\mu_{0}.\\) Assuming \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown, use the one-sample Student’s \\(t\\) test statistic: \\[ T=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu_{0}}{s/\\sqrt{n}}\\sim t_{n-1} \\] where \\(\\bar{x}=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}{n}\\) and \\(s=\\sqrt{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1}}\\) A \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\)% CI for \\(\\mu\\) is given by \\[ \\bar{x}\\pm t_{n-1}^{(\\alpha/2)}\\displaystyle\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\] where \\(t_{n-1}^{(\\alpha/2)}\\) is the critical value such that \\(P\\left(T&gt;t_{n-1}^{(\\alpha/2)}\\right)=\\alpha/2\\) for \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. 2.10.2 One Sample \\(t\\) Test: Example A store sells ``16-ounce’’ boxes of Captain Crisp cereal.
