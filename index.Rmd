# Introduction

Welcome to Applied Statistics with `R`!

## About This Book

This book was originally (and currently) designed for use with STAT 420, Methods of Applied Statistics, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It may certainly be used elsewhere, but any references to "this course" in this book specifically refer to STAT 420.

This book is under active development. When possible, it would be best to always access the text online to be sure you are using the most up-to-date version. (Also, the html version provides additional features such as changing text size, font, and colors.) If you are in need of a local copy, a [**pdf version** is continuously maintained](http://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/applied_statistics.pdf).

Since this book is under active development you may encounter errors ranging from typos to broken code to poorly explained topics. If you do, please let us know! Simply send an email and we'll make the changes ASAP. (<dalpiaz2@illinois.edu>) Or, if you know RMarkdown and are familiar with GitHub, [make a pull request and fix an issue yourself!](https://github.com/daviddalpiaz/appliedstats) (This process is partially automated by the edit button in the top-left corner of the html version.)

This text uses MathJax to render mathematical notation for the web. Occasionally, but rarely, a JavaScript error will prevent MathJax from rendering correctly. (In which case, will see the "code" instead of the expected mathematical equations.) From experience, this is almost always fixed by simply refreshing the page. You'll also notice that if you right-click any equation you can obtain the MathML Code (for copying into Microsoft Word) or the TeX command used to generate the equation.

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]

## Conventions

`R` code will be typeset using a `monospace` font which is syntax highlighted.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
a = 3
b = 4
sqrt(a ^ 2 + b ^ 2)
```

`R` output lines, which would appear in the console will begin with `##`. They will generally not be syntax highlighted.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
a = 3
b = 4
sqrt(a ^ 2 + b ^ 2)
```
